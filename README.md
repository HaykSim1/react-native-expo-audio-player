####Its simple.

## Installation

Clone project, after:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

I use expoKit for this project, that why you can test it on your mobile very easy.

For audio player I use Expo Audio API  

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
# or
yarn start --reset-cache
```
